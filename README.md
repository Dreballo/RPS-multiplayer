# RPS-multiplayer

To play, find a friend and on two separate devices visit: https://rps-with-friends.herokuapp.com/ 

Only two users can play at the same time.
Each player chooses a move and then is told whether they won, lost, or there was a tie.
Each player's wins and losses will be tracked.
Throw some chat functionality in there, because no internet game is complete without having to endure endless taunts and insults from your opponent.
